"""Pure, ROS-free health core for the independent pipeline watchdog.

Mirrors the firmware's pure `as_transition` / `as_actuation` cores and this
repo's other pure cores (`mission_control.reconcile`, `cone_slam.lap_counter`):
no rclpy, no numpy, injected clock — so every branch is unit-testable off-node.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The uDV already runs a liveness watchdog on `/dv/status` (>= 2 Hz, stale at
`HEARTBEAT_STALE_S` = 400 ms → uDV trips to its safe state). That covers the
pipeline being **dead** — process crash, DDS silence, DVPC power loss.

It does NOT cover the pipeline being **alive but sick**: mission_control
happily publishing `DV_RUNNING` at 20 Hz while SLAM has stopped solving. That
is not hypothetical — it is the documented runaway (see
`control/control/controllers/pi_velocity.py`, throttle_max rationale):

    "pose froze, controller kept commanding full throttle, real car ran away
     to ~24 m/s and crashed"

`control_node` caches the last pose forever and has no staleness check of its
own, so a frozen `/slam/pose` leaves it driving blind on stale state while the
uDV's heartbeat watchdog sees a perfectly healthy DVPC. This core closes that
gap. The two watchdogs are complementary, not redundant:

    uDV watchdog      : "is the DVPC alive?"      (heartbeat on /dv/status)
    pipeline watchdog : "is the DVPC's data sane?" (this module)

TWO INDEPENDENT CHECKS
----------------------
1. **Liveness** — a critical topic has gone silent past its budget. This is
   what catches the documented incident: when SLAM strands (cascade-skip,
   see cone_graph_slam_node "cones lose alignment ... /slam/pose freezes"),
   the scan path returns before publishing, so the topic simply stops.

2. **Pose progress** — `/slam/pose` is still arriving, but its position is not
   advancing while `/odom` says the car is moving. Catches the nastier variant
   where SLAM keeps republishing a stale solve. Liveness alone would miss it.

Both are latching: once tripped, a run never un-trips. Clearing requires a new
run (mission_control resets on a fresh cycle). This is deliberate — an
intermittent sensor that recovers for one scan must not silently rearm the car.

ARMING
------
The monitor only supervises while the pipeline is genuinely driving. It is
armed off `/dv/status == DV_RUNNING`, which is the pipeline's own statement
that it is activated and relaying `/ctrl/cmd`. Consequences of arming off that
byte, all intended:
  * Free-run / data-collection floor (autonomy up, human driving) never trips
    EBS — the floor never reaches DV_RUNNING.
  * A torn-down or idle stack never trips.
  * It reuses the one byte both sides already agree on, rather than inventing
    a second notion of "are we running".

After arming, a grace window absorbs node spin-up (JIT warm-up, first LiDAR
scan, first solve) before any budget applies. Within the grace window nothing
can trip. After it, a topic that has *never* published is treated as stale —
"SLAM never started" is as fatal as "SLAM stopped".
