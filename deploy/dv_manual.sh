# dv_manual.sh — record a rosbag during MANUAL driving, WITHOUT the pipeline.
#
# Started by dv-manual.service (`dv manual`). Brings up ONLY the sensor layer
# (Hesai LiDAR driver + static TFs, via car_sensors.launch.py) — NOT
# mission_control, NOT the autonomy lifecycle nodes — then records the full
# sensor graph, exactly like the race recorder:
#
#   /lidar_points  raw cloud     ← Hesai driver (started here)
#   /imu /motor_rpm /steering_angle  ← the uDV, over microros-agent.service
#                                      (independent of this; present if it's up)
#
# Why this exists: DV testing time is scarce, so we want a bag from every run
# including manual laps (offline perception/SLAM/odom development replays the
# manual bag through the pipeline later). The race recorder is bolted to
# dv-pipeline.service and waits for /dv/status, so it can't record manual
# driving. This is the manual-mode twin.
#
# Lifecycle: the sensor launch runs in the background inside this unit's cgroup;
# the recorder runs in the foreground (exec). `dv stop` / `systemctl stop
# dv-manual.service` sends SIGINT to the whole cgroup (KillMode=control-group),
# so rosbag2 finalizes the bag AND the sensor nodes shut down cleanly.
#
# Bags land in the same place as race bags (/home/isc/bags) with a `manual_`
# prefix. Honours /etc/dv/norecord. Same disk floor + best-effort QoS handling
# as dv_record.sh (this reuses it).
#
# Versioned in IFS08-DV-PIPELINE/deploy/ (installed to /usr/local/bin by
# install_dv_pipeline_service.sh).
