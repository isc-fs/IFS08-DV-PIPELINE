# dv_automission.sh — record a manual sensor bag when Manual is confirmed on AMI.
#
# Always-on watcher (dv-automission.service, enabled at boot). Recording is
# GATED ON MISSION SELECTION: it subscribes to the uDV's /ami/mission and only
# starts the manual recorder when the operator CONFIRMS Manual (index 0).
#
#   mission 0 (Manual confirmed) + pipeline NOT up → start dv-manual.service
#   mission 1..9 (a real mission confirmed)        → stop  dv-manual.service
#   mission -1 (up, nothing confirmed) / not seen  → leave state untouched
#   /etc/dv/norecord present                       → stop + stay idle (opt-out)
#
# Why mission-gated: recording only when a mission is selected means NO spurious
# bag from mere power-on and NO fight over the Hesai driver with `dv race`. To
# record a manual bag you SELECT + CONFIRM Manual on the AMI — one deliberate
# action, exactly as the operator asked. (Per uDV#189 the AMI emits an index
# only on confirm, not dial position; Manual=0 needs a confirm like any mission.
# /ami/mission publishes continuously, ASMS-off, no pipeline — confirmed there —
# so this works with the ASMS off during manual driving.)
#
# It never sends anything to the car; it only reads /ami/mission and starts/stops
# a local systemd unit. No autonomy runs — the manual bag is sensors only.
#
# Reconcile loop (not edge-triggered): re-evaluates every DV_AUTOMISSION_POLL
# seconds so the pipeline-guard is rechecked too — confirm-Manual while the
# pipeline is still up must not start the recorder, but a later `dv stop` must.
#
# Versioned in IFS08-DV-PIPELINE/deploy/ (installed to /usr/local/bin by
# install_dv_pipeline_service.sh).
