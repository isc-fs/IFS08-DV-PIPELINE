"""pipeline_watchdog_node — independent supervisor for the autonomy stack.

Deliberately NOT a lifecycle node and NOT in AUTONOMY_NODE_ORDER: mode_manager
must not be able to configure, deactivate or tear it down. It comes up with the
management trio and runs for the whole session, exactly so it still supervises
when the thing it supervises is broken. Same reasoning as the uDV running its
watchdog outside the mission logic it watches.

WHAT IT COVERS (and what it does not)
-------------------------------------
The uDV already watchdogs `/dv/status` for DVPC liveness (stale > 400 ms →
uDV trips to its safe state). That covers the pipeline being **dead**.

This node covers the pipeline being **alive but sick** — mission_control
publishing DV_RUNNING at 20 Hz while the data underneath it has gone stale.
That is the documented runaway (see `pi_velocity.throttle_max` rationale):
"pose froze, controller kept commanding full throttle, real car ran away to
~24 m/s and crashed". `control_node` caches its last pose/odom forever and has
no staleness check of its own, so nothing else in the stack notices.

    uDV watchdog      : "is the DVPC alive?"        heartbeat on /dv/status
    pipeline watchdog : "is the DVPC's data sane?"  this node

The two are complementary. If mission_control itself hangs, THIS node's
emergency would not get relayed — but that exact case is already covered by the
uDV's heartbeat watchdog going stale. Neither watchdog needs to cover both.

WHICH TOPICS ARE SUPERVISED, AND WHY ONLY THESE
-----------------------------------------------
Only topics whose staleness leaves the car **still driving on stale data**:

  /slam/pose         frozen pose → control drives blind → the documented runaway
  /odom              frozen speed → PI reads "too slow" → commands more throttle
  /ctrl/cmd_internal control_node died → mission_control stops relaying

Deliberately NOT supervised, because they already fail safe:
  /Path        control_node publishes a zeroed command when the reference is
               empty, so a planner dropout coasts rather than runs away.
  /Conos_raw   its loss surfaces as /slam/pose or /Path staleness one hop later;
               supervising it directly would only add false-trip surface.

Adding a topic here is a safety decision, not a monitoring nicety: every extra
supervised topic is another way to fire the EBS at speed on a false positive.

ON TRIP
-------
Latches `/watchdog/emergency = true`. mission_control subscribes, and on the
rising edge calls `/force_ebs` (with its own ack-retry) and publishes
`DV_EMERGENCY` — the uDV then drives the AS state machine to AS Emergency. The
pipeline never touches the AS machine directly; it only ever asks.
